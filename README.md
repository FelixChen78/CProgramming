# kr-exercises
This is a collection of C exercises from K&amp;R second edition

The main.c file in each chapter contain the chapter exercises. Each chapter folder contains exercise folders which are labeled accordingly. Must run each main file via command line. Running on a traditional IDE like CLION may not work because there are multiple main.c files.
